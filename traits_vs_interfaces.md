# Traits vs Interfaces  
although traits and interfaces try to implement the same mechanism, interfaces are strictly OO based.  
Traits can do the same as interfaces.  

But there is one fundamental difference:  
**traits define behaviour from outside of the type, not within it.**  
This makes them viable for more use cases and can even be used to implement functionality on a type you have otherwise no control over.  

specifically in a C# context: Traits are a interfaces as Extensions.
